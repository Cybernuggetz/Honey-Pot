# HONEYPOT

## Objective

The Honey Pot Lab project aims to create a virtual control environment to simulate attacks that could potentially harm the company. As malicious actors grow increasingly sophisticated, many zero-day exploits not yet integrated into Threat Intelligence Feeds can bypass existing security configurations and cause operational damage. The lab captures live traffic from malicious actors and feeds it into the company’s Threat Intelligence system, enabling updates to security configurations to include previously unknown threats, thereby strengthening the company’s security posture. Additionally, the lab provides personalized configurations to identify and mitigate threats specifically targeting the company, neutralizing them before they can materialize.

### Skills Learned


- Creation of cloud virtaul machine and deployment. 
- Windows log ingesting into Azure cloud.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Usage of Kql to query the ingested log.
- Creation of Watchlsit to resolve attacker IP to countryname.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.
- Visualisation of log in a map and chart.

### Tools Used


- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Usage of remote desktop client tool to access the virtaul machine.
- Microsoft Sentinel workbook to visualise the IP to country of location.
